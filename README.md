# RaveNet-App
## A Decentralized Offgrid MeshNet Raver Network App

RaveNet is a decentralized off-grid mesh network app designed for ravers, built using React Native for both iOS and Android platforms.

## Overview

RaveNet aims to provide a communication platform for ravers that operates independently of traditional internet infrastructure. By leveraging decentralized technologies and mesh networking protocols, users can connect directly with each other, share information, and discover nearby events even in areas with limited or no internet connectivity.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Communication**: Connect directly with other users without relying on central servers.
- **Mesh Networking**: Form a network of devices to enable communication in areas without internet access.
- **Offline Functionality**: Use the app even when offline, allowing users to communicate and share information regardless of connectivity.
- **Event Discovery**: Find nearby events and connect with other attendees.
- **Privacy and Security**: Ensure user privacy and security through encryption and authentication mechanisms.
- **Community Building**: Foster a sense of community within the app through user profiles, groups, and shared content.
